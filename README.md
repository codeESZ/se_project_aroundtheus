**Intro**

This project is suppose to let users add, edit,like and remove there picture.

**technologies and techniques**
This project effectively combines semantic HTML5, modular CSS, and BEM methodology to create a responsive and accessible static web page. These techniques ensure scalability, maintainability, and cross-device compatibility.
**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Es8zZP3ARGH9JGcw60i3OD/Sprint-3_-Around-the-US?node-id=6432-147&node-type=frame&t=9pawp4RptSpD8lzQ-0)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
